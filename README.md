Complementary files for the paper "Euler characteristic of gothic Teichmüller curves".
Joint work with Martin Möller (Goethe-Universität Frankfurt).
Lack of a complete documentation due to its main use as personal computational support.
WARNING: Some files use the programs "triangulated_surface" and "wg_spine" of Ronen Mukamel.

Abstract: We compute the Euler characteristics of the recently discovered series of Gothic Teichmüller curves. The main tool is the construction of "Gothic" Hilbert modular forms vanishing at the images of these Teichmüller curves.
Contrary to all previously known examples, the Euler characteristics are not proportional to the Euler characteristic of the ambient Hilbert modular surfaces. This results in interesting "varying" phenomena for Lyapunov exponents.
